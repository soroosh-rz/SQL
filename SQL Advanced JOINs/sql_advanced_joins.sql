/*
If you have time series data, limiting to a small time window can make your queries run 
more quickly.

Testing your queries on a subset of data, finalizing your query, then removing the subset 
limitation is a sound strategy.

When working with subqueries, limiting the amount of data youâ€™re working with in the place 
where it will be executed first will have the maximum impact on query run time.
